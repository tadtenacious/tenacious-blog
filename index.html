My name is Tad Peterson, and welcome to my blog. My goal is to share usefull skills and knowledge that I learned the hard way so you don't have to, whether it was from my master's degree research [predicting inpatient hospital readmission using machine learning](https://github.com/tadtenacious/nrd_db_proj), or how I transitioned from a non technical background to a career in data, there should be something for everyone.
